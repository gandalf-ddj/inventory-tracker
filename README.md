# Inventory Management System

A terminal-based inventory tracking application written in Python. This project allows you to manage products and ingredients, store data persistently using a JSON file, and interact through a simple text-based menu.

## Features

- 📦 Add new inventory items  
- 👀 View current inventory  
- ✏️ Edit existing items  
- ❌ Delete items  
- 🔍 Search inventory by name  
- 💾 Persistent data storage with JSON  
- 🧠 Simple, clean, menu-driven interface  

## How It Works

- When the program starts, it loads inventory data from `inventory.json`  
- Users interact with the menu to manage items  
- All changes are saved automatically after any add/edit/delete action  
- If no file exists, a new one is created on first save
